# Weather Dashboard
## Description
This is a web app made using the OpenWeather API, to display a weather dashboard that you can see in a browser. 
Using this app allows you to see today's weather data for a specific city, as well as a five day forecast into the future. 
By checking out the weather prognostic, you'll be better informed to make decisions based on weather ie. if it rains on Wednesday then mow the lawn on Thursday.
Check the Usage section for a more detailed description on the functionality.
This dashboard was created to learn how to utilize an API to dynamically display content on a page. 
Things learned include learning how to use fetch functions, using DOM traversal to request specific information, using template literals and learning to use an API key.


## Usage
![Weather Dashboard Image]()

Visit Page: https://kanabaki.github.io/weather-dashboard/
Provide instructions and examples for use.
When I first load the page I see an aside section with a search bar to the left and a title for the app on the top of the page. When I search for a city,
the right side of the page will display weather information for that city. At the top of this section is a main page with the name of the city searched displaying temperature, a weather icon, wind speed, and humidity.
Under that section is a 5 day forecast with similar information but for the following days. You can then see that the aside section now contains a history of cities searched, and can be accessed by clicking, to bring up weather info once more.
